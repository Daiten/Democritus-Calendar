# Democritus calendar
## What if we tracked dates by elements?

### Basics
This is a single-serving website that will convert current date and time to "Democritus calendar". Democritus calendar starts about 460 BC and year is long only 92 days. Each day gets assigned element based on proton number.
Year (named here as era) also gets name after element. You will then have combination of era of [element] and day of [element].
